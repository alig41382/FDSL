# FDSL - Feature Definition DSL

**FDSL** is a domain-specific language for defining machine learning features in a clean, reusable, and consistent way. It enables teams to declare features once and automatically generate production-ready code across multiple environments, including Python (Pandas), SQL, monitoring configs, and real-time API schemas.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Human-readable syntax** for feature definitions
- **Automatic code generation** for:
  - Python (Pandas)
  - SQL
  - YAML (Monitoring configs)
  - JSON (API schemas)
- **Single source of truth** for feature logic
- Promotes **collaboration, auditability, and consistency**
